# Python from image file to Base64 string

This small script is meant to help files like MardDown or HTML to hold images without needing the image file itself by usng a Base64 encode.

# How to use this utility

## Install Python3

[Python download official](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Install all dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the script

```bash

python3 main.py path/to/image.png

Once the script is done, the base64 string is automatically copied to your clipboard ready to be pasted!
